/**
 * Community card poker refers to any game of poker that uses community cards
 * (also called "shared cards" or "window cards"), which are cards dealt face up
 * in the center of the table and shared by all players. In these games, each
 * player is dealt privately an incomplete hand ("hole cards"), which are then
 * combined with the community cards to make a complete hand.
 * 
 * The set of community cards is called the "board", and may be dealt in a
 * simple line or arranged in a special pattern. Rules of each game determine
 * how they may be combined with each player's private hand. The most popular
 * community card game today is Texas hold 'em, originating sometime in the
 * 1920s.
